Description
The more we use our computers the messy our directories become.

What do I mean this ?

Well we are constantly downloading, creating and adding new files to our
directories in an unorder manner. Before we know it our directories has
become a cesspool of files where we can no longer make head or tails and less
not mention searching for files.

What this program does is tidies your directory or reclusive tidies your
directory if that option is selected by sorting the files into
folders based on the year, date and the file extenstion their were created.

For example if you have a file in your computer that was created on the
10th march 2014 and the file is a PDF file located on the Desktop.
Then the program would create the folder named 2014 the year the file was created
 and within that folder it would created 10_march_2014 the date the file was created
 and finally it would create another folder called pdf_files the extenstion used for the file.
Finally it would move the file to that folder and viola no more untidy files.

Now you have files in sort order based on the year and date their were created
